For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back. With the bench perpendicular to your body, and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width. The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso. This will be your starting position.
Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.
Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Bird-Dog Crunch: Get on the floor on all fours, hands placed directly underneath your shoulders, hips in line with your knees to start. then, lift your right hand and extend your arm straight out in on you, have it shoulder height, while simultaneously lifting your left leg and extending it straight back (a). Your whole body should be in a straight line from right fingertips to left toes. Bring your left leg to touch your right elbow under your stomach. Extend your leg and arm out again. Return to starting position (b). Repeat on the other side (c). Do five reps on each side.

Sit-Ups: To start, sit on the floor with your knees bent, heels touching the floor, hands on either side of your head, shoulders dropped and relaxed to avoid tension in the neck. Keeping your feet on the ground, lay back until your back is flat on the floor, or as far as youâ€™re able (a). Rise back up (b). Continue for one-minute straight, then take a 10 second break. Repeat for three rounds.

Spider Plank Crunch: Start in a push-up position, hands on the ground directly underneath your shoulders, with legs extended backwards with your toes on the ground, so your body would be in a straight line. Lift your right leg and bring your knee to the outside of your right elbow (a). Return to plank position (b). Repeat the movement with the other leg. Do five reps with each leg.

Fingers to Toes: Lie on your back with your legs straight and extended toward the ceiling, with arms down on your sides. Exhale and clench your abs as you crunch up from your waist and extend your hands toward your toes. Keep your back flat on the floor. Work up to 2 sets of 10 reps.

Front Plank: Get on your hands and knees to start. Keeping your back and ab muscles clenched, get down to your forearms while extending legs out behind you so you are resting on the balls of your feet.
