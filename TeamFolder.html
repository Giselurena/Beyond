Do 10 of these and Rest for 10 seconds. Do 3 reps of this.

Next, we’re going to work with Planks

Planks help you to build strength in your core, upper and lower body so its a good full body work out.

Start by getting into a press-up position.
Bend your elbows and rest your weight on your forearms and not on your hands.
Your body should form a straight line from shoulders to ankles.
Engage your core by sucking your belly button into your spine.

We’re going to continue on with
The Inchworm.
This helps work out the shoulders, abs, and back.

Start standing with feet hip-width apart. Hinge forward at your hips and place your palms on the mat. You can bend your knees if needed to get your palms flat on the floor.
Walk your hands forward so that you’re in high plank. Your shoulders should be stacked directly above your wrists.
For an extra challenge, add a push-up.
Walk your hands back toward feet and stand up.

Lateral Plank Walks
Perfect for improving your shoulders, arms, AND core.

Start in high plank with your shoulders above your wrists and abs tight.
Step your right foot and your right hand to right side immediately following with your left foot and your left hand. Take a few "steps" in one direction, then walk in the opposite direction.


We’re going to pushing through a
Burpee With Push-Up

Start standing with your feet hip-distance apart and bring your palms to the floor.
Jump your feet back so that you are in high plank, keeping your core tight and your hips lifted.
Bend your elbows and lower yourself into a push-up, then push back up into high plank.
Now jump your feet to the outside of your hands. As you stand up, explode up and jump as high as you can, bringing your arms overhead.

Bench Dips

For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back.

Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.
Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.
